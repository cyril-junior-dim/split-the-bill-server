# Split The Bill Server

<h2>Description</h2>
The aim of our application is to provide people with a simple tool that allows people to wisely split and manage shared expenses. Calculating exact amounts due, as well as working out effective systems of compensating each other will become a straightforward and logged process.
<br />
<br />
The front-end implementation requires that the installation package be run to completion. After initial installation, users have limited access to the application unless they register with valid credentials. The target device will also be required to support the Java SDK.
<br />
<br />

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Aside from the pre-requirements in the form of the configuration file there are some dependencies which the application requires in order to run. They are contained within the pom.xml file. However if we consider the result program the dependencies are contained within the executable jar. Such a program will require Java Development Kit version 11 installed in order to run.

The resulting program is an executable jar file. The file requires Java Development Kit version 11 installed in order to run. The file is then run on a server and responds to REST requests from the mobile app or even third party services.

<h2>Languages Used</h2>
