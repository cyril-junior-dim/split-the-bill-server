== User account
User account is a starting point of the app. Based on the user account, the token is generated
which is then required to authenticate the user. Please note that `/auth/*` is the only endpoint path
that can be accessed without the token. All other endpoints will not allow the user to interact with any data
unless they provide the token.

=== Basic user account
Basic user account requires a user to provide a username, password and email. Username and email have to be UNIQUE. +
NOTE! After creating a basic user account it is necessary to create a `Person`.

=== Third party user account

the account is created and the API redirects the user to the client app with token embedded in the URL. +
